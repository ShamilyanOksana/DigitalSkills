Gas Price API
For Ethereum transactions, gas price is a delicate property. For this reason, Web3 includes an API for configuring it.

By default, Web3 will not include a gasPrice in the transaction as to relay this responsibility to the connected node. 
The Gas Price API allows you to define Web3’s behaviour for populating the gas price. 
This is done using a “Gas Price Strategy” - a method which takes the 
Web3 object and a transaction dictionary and returns a gas price (denominated in wei).
